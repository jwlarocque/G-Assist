# Home Assistant Plugin for NVIDIA G-Assist

## Prerequisites

- G-Assist
- A Home Assistant server
  - The server must be accessible from the PC running G-Assist
- Python (3.13 or later recommended)

## Home Assistant MCP Server Installation

Install the [Model Context Protocol Server plugin for Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/). We'll be using HTTP transport, so you do not need a stdio proxy.  
(Note: you do not *need* a separate MCP client, as this plugin takes that role, but you may want to install one for testing.)  

[Generate a long-lived access token](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/#long-lived-access-tokens) and save it for later. 

(Optional) With the MCP client of your choice, verify that tool calls to Home Assistant are working.

## Plugin Installation

Clone or download this repository:  
```
git clone https://github.com/jwlarocque/G-Assist.git
cd G-Assist/plugins/home-assistant
```

Run the one-time setup script:
```
setup.bat
```

Open `config.json.example` with the text editor of your choice.  
Fill in your MCP server URL and access token from the MCP server installation above.  
Save as `config.json`.

Run the build script:
```
build.bat
```


Create this folder (if G-Assist is installed, all but the `home-assistant` directory should already exist):  
```
"%programdata%\NVIDIA Corporation\nvtopps\rise\plugins\home-assistant"
```

Copy `home-assistant-plugin.exe`, `manifest_template.json`, `manifest.json`, and `config.json` from the `G-Assist/plugins/home-assistant/dist/home-assistant` folder (inside the repo you cloned earlier - these were generated by `build.bat`) into that new folder.

## Usage

Open G-Assist and start your prompt with `Hey home-assistant` or `/home-assistant`, followed by your command. For best results, mention the exact name of a device on your Home Assistant server.

### Logs

This plugin will log any errors to `%USERPROFILE%\home-assistant-plugin.log`, usually.

### Functionality

The following functions are supported (provided they're set up in your Home Assistant).  You may use their full name when asking G-Assist to invoke them, but do not need to.  
To see which functions are supported by your current installation, inspect `manifest.json` as generated in the instructions above.
